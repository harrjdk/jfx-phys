This is an EXTREMELY rough, in progress effort to recreate asteroids in javafx

There's a lot to do but off the top of my head:

* Wrap around

* Scoring

* Screen clear item

* Improved asteroid spawn logic

* Start/Exit/Pause

Running:

`mvn clean javafx:run`

Playing:

Click anywhere on the screen to spawn your ship

space bar launches pellets, W/S is accelerate/reverse A/D is rotate left/right, and Z is full stop. 3 pellets are allowed to exist at anytime. If you are hit by an asteroid, click to restart.
